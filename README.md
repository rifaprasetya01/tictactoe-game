# Hello, Rifa Prasetya here..!

This time I made a simple game again.
What game is that..?
Yep. Of course, Tic-Tac-Toe!
Eh? Why did I make it..?
Of course. Apart from having fun, I also learned how to make games as well as learning OOP in Javascript.
Hope you like it, and don't forget to give your stars which are very valuable to me. Then, see you!
